Reminder management app (xAMP)

Focusing on recurrence functionality. Release 1.x is an xAMP standalone solution. Release 2.x is designed to solve the recurrence problem in a heterogenous CalDAV client environment, in which various clients often ignore or undo each other's changes.

Built on Hydrogen framework (clone the Hydrogen repository inside this project's htdocs folder and then add it to your .gitignore)

Testing Release 2.x with Hydrogen v1.x
